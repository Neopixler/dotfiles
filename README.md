# Dotfiles Repository

A dotfiles repository is a collection of configuration files used to customize and personalize your development environment. These files typically include settings for your shell, text editor, version control system, and other tools you use on a daily basis. By storing these configuration files in a version-controlled repository, you can easily share your setup with others, keep track of changes, and quickly set up a new environment when needed.
